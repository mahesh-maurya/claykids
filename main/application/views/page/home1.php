<div class="text"><h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>It is simple to understand how significant physical growth and academic development is in the life of a child but what about the emotional and social development?</p>
<p>When our kids grow taller, or learn to talk / walk, it's so obvious to see. Yet when our children understand how to care, share, respect, wait for their turn or make their own friends, it often goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>The development of the social and emotional health of a child is essential for proper behavior, understanding of life and transition from childhood to adulthood. It enables the child to effectively deal with the demands and challenges of everyday life.</p>
<p>Social &amp; Emotional development assists in shaping a childs future. It has a significant impact on what he will become later in life. Social skills are all about a child's ability to cooperate and play with others, paying attention and listening to adults and teachers, building positive relationships and making reasonable transitions from activity to activity. Emotional development is the process of learning how to understand, manage and control emotions. </p>
   <p>Grooming program for kids at Clay is all about emotional and social learning.</p>
   <p>Talking about a child's all round development, how can we forget the horrors of child abuse that few of the tender hearts face? And not to forget the impact it leaves on those who go through it. Whenever we hear or read about a child abuse incident, we are angered. Some of us also may want to do something about it, but feel helpless or may wonder how they can help, the problem is huge.
At times we may also like to believe that my family is safe and I need not worry about it. It will never happen to my child but the statistics on child sexual abuse are scary and we can no longer be sure.</p>
    <p>"Child Sexual Exploitation (CSA) is an epidemic.  And what are we doing about it?
"</p>
    <p>We have to all work and do our bit at community level to tackle this epidemic. We at CLAY are conducting workshop for children on Child sexual Abuse to empower and educate the children in keeping themselves safe. We also conduct workshops for parents, teachers and other caregivers which equips them with necessary skills and attitude to prevent instances of child sexual abuse.</p>
